Nimble Elements -- Web Application Framework.

Nimble compiles a set of files and directories into a custom element based application of two single files: index.html and bundle.js.

The system provides a framework for developers to quickly and simply create and extend a web application with the frameworks, libraries and elements of their choice.


Nimble's goal is to make starting and developing an app simple, quick and painless while allowing latitude in choice of library and framework.
