Nimble Elements -- Web Application Framework.

Nimble compiles a set of files and directories into a custom element based application of a single file: index.html.

It is a framework to quickly and simply create and extend web applications with the frameworks, libraries and elements of your choice.


Nimble's goal is to make starting and developing an app simple, quick and painless while allowing latitude in choice of library and framework.
