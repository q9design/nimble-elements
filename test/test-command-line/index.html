		This is fun that it updates auto and builds auto.
		<p>will be neat when this is more solid. I already like it!!!! idk !!!!! it is.. just slow.
		<p>Next would be good to think a bit more about the in browser version.. how might it work with libs, and previews and such... need service worker? can we load html directly into frame.. i think so.. even js?
